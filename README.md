Cee-Lo dice game in ReactJS

## About

Cee-Lo is a game of chance played with three six-sided dice.

Each game involves two to five players. A bet amount is decided upon and each player puts that amount in the pile or pot. Each person then goes on to roll all three dice at once, and continues to do so until a recognized combination, or number, is rolled.

The most common combination is two of the same number, and a third different number. The value of the roll is the third unique number. The objective is to have the highest valued roll to win. However, there some special combinations:

# CEE-LO React

Cee-Lo dice game in ReactJS

## About

Cee-Lo is a (2:5) player game of chance played with three six-sided dice.

Each player rolls all three dice at once, and continues to do so until one of the recognized combinations shown below is rolled.
The most common combination is two of the same number, and a third different number. The value of the roll is the third unique number.
The player with the highest valued roll rank wins.

If two or more players roll the same highest combination, a new round of the game begins between those players.
The rolling process again occurs, with only those left in the game rolling.
The game ends once there is a single winner in a round.
